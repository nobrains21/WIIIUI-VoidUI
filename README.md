Skin is based on UI for [Heaven's Fall](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/heavens-fall-melee-gameplay-mod.221137/) map, made by [Spellbound](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/spellbound.116571/), for Warcraft 3.
All credits for the art i used to make this skin should go to him. I own none of it and will remove this if promted.

# Installation
- Download [WIIIUI Addon](https://github.com/Fiurs-Hearth/WIIIUI) and install it;
- Click on the green "Code" button up top and choose "Download Zip";
- Download and unpack the archive. Find **custom3** folder inside.
- Move the custom3 folder in to **\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\WIIIUI\art**;
- Open addon menu in game and click on the Custom3 button to apply it;
 
In case you already have custom skins installed - change folder's name from **custom3** to **custom#**, where **#** is a number from 2-8, which is not currently used.
 
Feel free to bash me for leaving some unfinished stuff here and there. 
 
# Known issues:
- the chat bar goes as high as 83, making it any higher in the settings will break the left vertical line. I dont know how to make it longer.
